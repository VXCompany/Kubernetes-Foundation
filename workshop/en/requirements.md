### Optional: Install plugins

Visual Studio Code has a plugin system and uses a public Market Place to discover and install the plugins. You can find the extensions in the left menu in VS Code. More info on this extension system via the Docs: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery
