# Preparation workshop

> You can skip any preparation or requirement in case it is already installed or taken care of. Just make sure to finish the smoketest (at the end of this document) succesfully!

## Software requirements

We start with a number of software requirements:

- Git
- Docker Desktop (or you can bring your own alternative for the Docker Engine and CLI)
- Enable local Kubernetes integration (or work with your own alternative, i.e. Minikube)
- Optional: Visual Studio Code (or any other preferred text editor)
- Optional: Visual Studio Code plugins
- Optional: WSL2 on Windows

In case you need to install anything from this list, you can take a look at the [requirements](requirements.md). If everything is in place, you can continue with the preparations.
